Why BigData?

   We can't process huge amount of data classified under above 4V'S(Volume, Velocity, Variety and Veracity) in traditional systems
   To process the data first we need to find a way to store them.
   Where do we store such huge amount of data?
       Can we store and process 1 TB of data if I have storage capacity of 500 GB in single machine? No
       But same 1 TB of can be stored on 10 machines(100 GB each) and process subsequently. This is nothing but distributed system.
